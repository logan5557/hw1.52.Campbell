This design has a few short comings, the most major of which comes down to the main buttons the person operating it will be using being so low, while the ones they will hardly touch appear front and center. This, I found, if quite shocking and gives a moment of pause before operation. Furthermore, the buttons proceed from bottom left to top right, which is not how the floors are laid out, and this could have been easily avoided as there is ample space to have branched out. The layout and structure is just all together wrong.


The most common use for an elevator is most definitely getting in, and then selecting a floor to transpose to. In terms of other uses that are a bit more on the uncommon side, there is also using it to call for the fire department and other services, especially is the elevator is out. This interface makes those more rare uses easier to accomplish, as the buttons are right in your face, but the common use more difficult.


The most common mistake with this design is picking the wrong floor to go to, especially since its hard to understand the layout right off that bat and it isn’t the first thing that draws the eye. Beyond that, being so front and center, it would be a bit easier to accidentally push against the operation buttons can call something you might not mean to.

Most of my design decisions come down to making it easier to use, the two buttons outside straight to the point, the buttons on the inside drawing more attention to the floor buttons and separating off the operator buttons to the bottoms, as well as putting some quality of life features in there. First off, the buttons will light up blue so people that are red/green colorblind can see them, and the button will click in to signify if it is pressed or not, which also allows the user to unpress it if they want to cancel that floor number, which is also reflected from the LED. Finally, since Elavators also have audio boxes, it can be changed to read out a simple, “Hello, how may I help you?” and then be hooked up to receive certain voice commands like going to a certain floor, or the floor containing a room number, or a service.
